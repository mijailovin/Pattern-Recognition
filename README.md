# Pattern-Recognition
Implementing some machine learning concepts. Consists of several parts:
1. Classification of hand written cyrillic letters {A, E, I, O, U} using Bayes minimal error classification
2. Implementation of a Neyman-Pearson classifier; Implementation of a Wald's sequential test; o
  On generated 2D data for better visuals.
3. Implementation of optimal Linear classifies using two methods: classical Numerical method, and desired output method
4. Clustering algorithm using several methods on several types of generated classes. Implemented algorithms are:
  K-means, Maximum Likelihood estimation, Method of quadratic decompositions
